# Progress Report - MiraCole+ Backend API

## Initial Note

This project took a bit longer than expected, as it was necessary to build the backend completely from scratch, including all architecture, security, integrations, and authentication system. After some final testing, I'll work on the Render deployment.

    "credits_balance": 0,
    "language": "en",
    "playlist_count": 0,
    "watchlist_count": 0,
    "parental_settings": { "locked": false },

  - Expiration date ✅
  - Access validation
- ✅ Stripe integration (prepared for test keys)

### 7. Security System
- ✅ Login lockout: 7 attempts → 30 minutes block ✅
- ✅ Rate limiting per route:
  - Login: 7 attempts per 30 minutes
  - Device code: 7 per hour ✅
  - General: 1000 requests per hour
- ✅ Security headers (Helmet)
- ✅ CORS configured for production
- ✅ Tokens revoked on logout ✅

### 8. Video Endpoints (Base Structure)
- ✅ `GET /api/videos` - Video list (with pagination and search)
- ✅ `GET /api/videos/:videoId` - Video details and streaming URL
- ✅ `GET /api/videos/:videoId/analytics` - Video analytics
- ✅ `POST /api/videos/:videoId/watch` - Watch tracking
- ✅ Bunny CDN integration (read-only key)

### 9. Plans Endpoints
- ✅ `GET /api/plans` - PMPro plans list
  - Fallback to static IDs if WordPress unavailable

### 10. WordPress Plugin for /link
- ✅ Plugin created: `miracole-device-link`
- ✅ Shortcode `[miracole_device_link]`
- ✅ Interface to confirm device codes
- ✅ Integrated login on page
- ✅ JavaScript for API communication

### 11. Database
- ✅ Migrations created:
  - `users` (if needed for local cache)
  - `refresh_tokens` ✅
  - `devices` ✅
- ✅ Migration system configured

### 12. Documentation
- ✅ Complete README.md
- ✅ SETUP.md with detailed instructions
- ✅ API endpoints documentation
- ✅ Usage examples

## 📝 TECHNICAL NOTES

### Why did it take longer?
This backend was built completely from scratch, including:
- Complete JWT authentication architecture with RS256
- Robust rate limiting and lockout system
- Integrations with WordPress, PMPro and Bunny CDN
- Device linking system for Roku
- Database and migrations
- Logging and security system
- Complete documentation

All main Phase 1 requirements have been implemented. The placeholders (credits, playlist, watchlist) can be implemented later as needed.
